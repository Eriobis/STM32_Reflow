# Reflow Oven code

## Description

Simple PID to control a heater. I am going to use it as a reflow box and a filament dryer for my 3d filaments.
It's built for a rotary encoder and a 1306 oled display.

In menu.c there's a configurable matrix to add more pages and callback functions.

## Linux build vs master branch

- Added Makefile
- Changed the .ld file from EmBitz to the one generated by STM32CubeMx
